# The basic flow to copy e-book
*many ideas current in my mind, also updated time by time. Below is current one*

take Qt in project to hold the fixed size window,
1. take the user to main page
2. check if the user login, if not go to 3, or to 4
3. by scan the code to login
4. after login, show the bookstore belongs to that user
5. the user type in the book which want to copy
6. open that book, start to copy the whole book
7. put the content to one file
8. after the process finished, notify the user by one way
